\title{FPKM: fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments}
\usage{
fpkm(object, robust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{DESeqDataSet}}

\item{robust}{whether to use size factors to normalize
rather than taking the column sums of the raw counts,
using the \code{\link{fpm}} function.}
}
\value{
a matrix which is normalized per kilobase of the
union of basepairs in the \code{GRangesList} or \code{GRanges}
of the mcols(object), and per million of mapped fragments,
either using the robust median ratio method (robust=TRUE, default)
or using raw counts (robust=FALSE).
Defining a column \code{mcols(object)$basepairs} takes
precedence over internal calculation of the kilobases for each row.
}
\description{
The following function returns fragment counts normalized
per kilobase of feature length per million mapped fragments
(by default using a robust estimate of the library size,
as in \code{\link{estimateSizeFactors}}).
}
\details{
Note: the kilobase length of the features is calculated from the \code{rowData}
if a column \code{basepairs} is not present in \code{mcols(dds)}.
This is the number of basepairs in the union of all \code{GRanges}
assigned to a given row of \code{object}, e.g.,
the union of all basepairs of exons of a given gene.
When the read/fragment counting is interfeature dependent, a strict
normalization would not incorporate the basepairs of a feature which
overlap another feature. This interfeature dependence is not taken into
consideration in the internal union basepair calculation.

\examples{
# create a matrix with 1 million counts for the
# 2nd and 3rd column, the 1st and 4th have
# half and double the counts, respectively.
m <- matrix(1e6 * rep(c(.125, .25, .25, .5), each=4),
            ncol=4, dimnames=list(1:4,1:4))

se <- SummarizedExperiment(m, colData=DataFrame(sample=1:4))
dds <- DESeqDataSet(se, ~ 1)

# create 4 GRanges with lengths: 1, 1, 2, 2.5 Kb
gr1 <- GRanges("chr1",IRanges(1,1000))
gr2 <- GRanges("chr1",IRanges(c(1,501),c(500,1000)))

gr4 <- GRanges("chr1",IRanges(c(1,1001,2001),c(500,3000,3000)))
rowData(dds) <- GRangesList(gr1,gr2,gr3,gr4)

# the raw counts
counts(dds)

# the FPKM values
fpkm(dds)

# held constant per 1 million fragments
counts(dds) <- counts(dds) * 2L
round(fpkm(dds))
